### INIT()
I would center the title, but I won't bother with doing that in Markdown yet. I have a few ideas for our project throughout the semester. My main idea that I have currently is a social media platform
for world leaders. The platform will be advertised a method of ensuring world peace, but really it's to make world leaders mad at each other and ensure conflicts which will bring our company, Lockheed 
Marvin (Sidenote, I should have suggested Seaweed Marlin. Why didn't I come up with that earlier? It would have been much more humorous.), more profits. My other idea is to create a website called 
MageBook. It will be a social media service that anyone connected to the Planes-Wide-Orb can use. Any magic user from any universe who's connected to the orb could use it. Other than these two ideas, I 
don't have much at the moment, and thus ends my first entry.

### Small Update
I just got this repo on my desktop at home, which is currently running Ubuntu. This entry is mostly to make sure I set up my repo, keys, and everything correctly before I clone the team repo. I just
want to document another idea I have as well, though. I'm thinking that it could be a fun project, in the future, to create a new programming language. Nothing too complex because I can't think of
a reason to do something to complex. What I'm thinking of is pseudo-assembly. A language that works like any other assembly language, but all of it's functions are named appropriately as to be less
intimidating to someone learning assembly for the first time. I'm thinking that I could write it in Python, and of course all of the functions would just translate to something in Python. It wouldn't
allow the user to write assembly code that gets compiled straight to the processor; it would be more like an emulator. Everything that looks like it's in assembly would simply be fake: imitations of
assembly rules. The stack would simply be a python list that the user has to reserve. There will be 31 'registers', all mapped to variables. Why make this limited language? It could be a way to
introduce elementary schoolers and middle schoolers to assembly. They wouldn't need to set up any complex tools or worry configuring things on the command-line, nor would they need to worry about
unintuitive names for things. Just a thought.

### First Update in Awhile
This is the first update I've had in awhile. There really hasn't been anything of note to jot down, and as a result, I haven't updated this journal in a minute. We've started going over diagrams in class. This coupled with the requirements document has given some form to our amorphous blob of a software project. With diagrams, I can now more easily piece together what exactly we will need to create, and in what order. I also have a better idea of how to code the back-end of things. I'm thinking that each user will have a number of fields associated with them in the data base. The main Python code will pull this info and use it as needed. We are going to call the social media platform MyState. As for my other project, I have yet to have much will to work on it considering everything else I'm already doing. I plan on working on it a bit more as summer approaches. I at least want all of the design finished by April so that I can know exactly what technologies I need to learn how to use.
