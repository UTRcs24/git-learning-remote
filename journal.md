I would center the title, but I won't bother with doing that in Markdown yet. I have a few ideas for our project throughout the semester. My main idea that I have currently is a social media platform for world leaders. The platform will be advertised a method of ensuring world peace, but really it's to make world leaders mad at each other and ensure conflicts which will bring our company, Lockheed Marvin (Sidenote, I should have suggested Seaweed Marlin. Why didn't I come up with that earlier? It would have been much more humorous.), more profits. My other idea is to create a website called MageBook. It will be a social media service that anyone connected to the Planes-Wide-Orb can use. Any magic user from any universe who's connected to the orb could use it. Other than these two ideas, I don't have much at the moment, and thus ends my first entry.
